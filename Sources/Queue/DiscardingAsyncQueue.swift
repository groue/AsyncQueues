/// A queue that serializes async operations and discards cancelled ones.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// `DiscardingAsyncQueue` serialize asynchronous operations. Enqueued
/// operations run one after the other, in order, without overlapping.
///
/// Cancelled operations are eagerly discarded, without waiting for the
/// completion of previously enqueued operations. In this case, they throw
/// `CancellationError`.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```swift
/// let queue = DiscardingAsyncQueue()
///
/// // `perform` returns the result of the async operation.
/// // The operation is cancelled if the current task is cancelled.
/// let value = try await queue.perform {
///     try await someValue()
/// }
///
/// // `addTask` returns a new unstructured task that executes the
/// // async operation.
/// queue.addTask {
///     try await doSomething()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Creating a Queue
///
/// - ``init()``
///
/// ### Performing Operations
///
/// - ``perform(operation:)``
/// - ``addTask(operation:)``
