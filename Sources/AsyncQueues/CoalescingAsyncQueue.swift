/// A queue that serializes async operations, discards cancelled ones, and
/// can coalesce subsequent operations.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// `CoalescingAsyncQueue` serialize asynchronous operations. Enqueued
/// operations run one after the other, in order, without overlapping.
///
/// Cancelled operations are eagerly discarded, without waiting for the
/// completion of previously enqueued operations. In this case, they throw
/// `CancellationError`.
///
/// An operation that runs with the [`.discardable`](<doc:CoalescingAsyncQueue/Policy/discardable>)
/// policy is cancelled if it is replaced by another operation.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```swift
/// let queue = CoalescingAsyncQueue()
///
/// // `perform` returns the result of the async operation.
/// // The operation is cancelled if the current task is cancelled.
/// let value = try await queue.perform {
///     try await someValue()
/// }
///
/// // `addTask` returns a new unstructured task that executes the
/// // async operation.
/// queue.addTask {
///     try await doSomething()
/// }
///
/// // This task will be cancelled if another operation is enqueued.
/// queue.addTask(policy: .discardable) {
///     try await doSomething()
/// }
/// ```
